## Discription:

Security through Induced Boredom is a personal favourite approach of mine. Not as exciting as something like The Fray, but I love making it as tedious as possible to see my secrets, so you can only get one character at a time!
## Solution
I tried the IP address and the port with the Netcat command (nc) and found out that it asks for number and goes through a list and give me the character in each position.
I wrote a bash script to and used loops to put the flag together until I reach the "}" character which usually indicates that the flag is finished!
