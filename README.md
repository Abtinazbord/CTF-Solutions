# CTF-Solutions

Welcome to my collection of solutions for **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges! 

I started with **Hack The Box** (HTB) challenges, but I plan to post solutions for other CTF platforms as I continue solving new challenges.
## Repository Structure

Each challenge is stored in its own folder with the following:
- **`README.md`**: Describes the challenge and my approach to solving it.
- **Solution Script(s)**: The script or tool I used to solve the challenge.
- **Notes**: Any additional explanations, thoughts, or research.
